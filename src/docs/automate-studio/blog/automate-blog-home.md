# Automate Studio Tutorials

Welcome to the tutorial section of Automate Studio! This section houses our technical blogs intended to serve both as examples of how to think about use-cases for Automate Studio and then actually dig in and execute.

## Goals

Our goal for these blog utorials is to give you the understanding, and a little shot of curiosity, to start developing your own flow solutions in Automate Studio.

Each of these posts is structured almost like a product requirements document in miniature: we focus on the problem use-case that we could address, rapidly deploy, and iterate on to prove value as a flow created in Automate Studio.

Once we have our use-case defined, we then discuss how we have implemented our solution in Automate Studio, going step by step into each of the logical blocks encapsulated in the visual nodes. The idea is that Automate Studio quickly allows both non-engineers and technical folks to deploy and test an AI solution and bring it to market in a timeline measured in days and weeks, not months.
