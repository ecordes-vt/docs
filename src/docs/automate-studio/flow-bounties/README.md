# Automate Studio Ambassador Program
Below you will find a wishlist of Automate flows that we, at Veritone, hope to have 3rd party developers help us build. In order to incentivize building these flows, we have placed bounties on them. For each flow a developer creates, the specified bounty will be paid out.

## How to build flows and make money? <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
Developers and Business Analysts, contribute to the Automate Studio flow library and claim a bounty. Here’s how:

1. Review the [wish list](#automate-flow-wishlist) of Automate Studio flows
2. Choose which flow to develop, or suggest a new flow for Veritone to review and add to the list
3. Build the flow you’ve selected, according to the flow specifications
4. Submit your completed flow for Veritone review and approval

If approved, Veritone will pay you the specified bounty amount for that flow. Then, spread the word by marketing your flows to others. Each time those you refer sign up through your flow and become active users, you get paid.*
