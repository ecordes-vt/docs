## aiware-agent

Provides CLI as well as launching edge services as agent

### Synopsis

An Edge is deployed by installing and running a single executable, aiWARE Agent.  Agent is responsible
for the installation and management of all Edge Subsystems described throughout this document.
EA provides environment and installation parameters to the subsystem being launched.
In an Edge deployment, Agent is the only native process that is run directly on the host operating system.
All other subsystems are launched by agent as docker containers.
