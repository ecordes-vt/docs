## aiware-agent agent

Initializes edge services, monitors host stats, launches, terminates and monitors docker containers

### Synopsis

An Edge is deployed by installing and running a single executable, Edge Agent (EA).  EA is responsible
for the installation and management of all Edge Subsystems described throughout this document.
EA provides environment and installation parameters to the subsystem being launched.
In an Edge deployment, EA is the only native process that is run directly on the host operating system.
All other subsystems are launched by EA as docker containers.
